# "Stock.r"

> Work in progress. A few things aren't working yet. It's a demo.

### Getting started

You need first to install the dependencies. You also need a MongoDB database.
```
$ npm install
```

Then, you have to start the project. A file named `file.json` will be created, to allow you to change the database's IP address.

```
$ npm start
```

You can use the argument `populate` to add 1000 users, products and a few demands to it.

```
$ npm populate
```
